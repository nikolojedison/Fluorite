<p>Fluorite, named after the mineral form of calcium fluoride, is a Rainmeter skin designed to be functional and modeled after the interfaces seen in various Halo media, especially Halo Nightfall and Halo Reach. </p>

<p>As Fluorite is nowhere near complete, please submit any and all bugs as soon as you discover them with as much documentation as you can, but only after you look and see if someone else has already had your issue. Features will be added as close to the deadlines as I can add them.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time, and please enjoy this skin!</p>
